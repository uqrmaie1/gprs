Column	Explanation
score file	Name of score input file
covariates file	Name of covariates input file (optional)
N	Total sample size (numer of individuals with GPRS)
Propcase	P; proportion of Target sample that are cases (for case-control data)
NKr2	Nagelkerke's R2 (pseudo-R2 measure as used in the original paper by Purcell, Wray et al. in Nature; the R2 attributable to the GPRS after fitting covariates)
pval	P-value for the significance of the regression of GPRS on phenotype
PopRisk	K; lifetime risk (prevalence) of disease used in converting NKv to liability scale
h2l_r2n	Proportion of variance explained (R2) by the score on the liability scale. See Lee et al. in Genetic Epidemiology 2012 (PMID: 22714935)
se_h2l_r2	Standard error of the R2 on the liability scale
AUC	What we think is the most appropriate estimate of AUC (area under the Receiver Operator Curve) attributed to the score (but there may be a better way to estimate AUC attributable to the score after fitting covariates)
OR10decile	The odds ratio when comparing top (10th) decile to bottom (1st) decile
ORDL95	Lower boundary of the 95% CI of ORD
ORDH95	Upper boundary of the 95% CI of ORD
..	(the following appear in GPRS_deciles.csv)
ORD2	The odds ratio when comparing 2nd decile to bottom (1st) decile, i.e. 1st decile is 1, and everything else is relative to that
ORD2L	Lower boundary of the 95% CI of ORD2
ORD2H	Upper boundary of the 95% CI of ORD2
ORD3	The odds ratio when comparing 3rd decile to bottom (1st) decile
..	
ORD10	The odds ratio when comparing top (10th) decile to bottom (1st) decile
